- [ ] Code meets standards from previous weeks.

- [ ] Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.

- [ ] Application works as expected.

- [ ] Plain English specs are included in your README.

- [ ] Required functionality is in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline.

- [ ] Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

- [ ] Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.



## Bonus Objectives

- [ ] Style your site with CSS and images.

- [ ] Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.

## Learning Objectives

- [x] **Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.**

- [x] **JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.**

- [x] **Application implements a loop and works as expected.**

- [x] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).

- [x] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.

- [x] All previous objectives have been met.

- [x] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.

- [x] Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.

- [x] Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

## Additional Objectives

- [x] Add images and other custom aesthetics.

- [x] Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.

- [x] Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).

- [x] Add a second form field that takes a name. For numbers that are divisible by 3, replace the name Dave in "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that" with the name provided by the user.


## Specifications

- [x] Program replaces numbers containing "0" with "Beep!"
```
* Input: 0
* Output: ["Beep!"]
```
- [x] Program replaces numbers containing "1" with "Boop!"
```
* Input: 1
* Output: ["Boop!"]
```
- [x]  Program replaces numbers divisible by "3" with "Boop!"
```
* Input: 3
* Output: ["I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]
```
- [x]  Program generates a 2d array counting/iterating (from 0) up to a given number
```
* Input: 9
* Output: [[0],[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]]
```
- [x]  Program iterates through array, and pushes rule-based output to 1st index position of each element in array
```
* Input: [[0],[1],[2],[3]]
* Output: [[1,"Beep!"],[1,"Boop"],[2,"2"],[3,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"]]
```
- [x]  Program uses processed array data to populate output list
```
* Input: [[1,"Beep!"],[1,"Boop"],[2,"2"],[3,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"]]
* Output: "Beep!","Boop","2","I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"
```
- [x]  Program uses processed array data to populate reversed-order output list
```
* Input: [[1,"Beep!"],[1,"Boop"],[2,"2"],[3,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"]]
* Output: "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that","2","Boop","Beep!"
```
